# DKPList

A small addon to display dkp values stored in the officer's guild note by [SotA](https://github.com/Sentilix/sota).

Left click the minimap button to display the interface. Right click and hold the minimap button to drag it.

Left clicking a class button will add or remove all entries of the corresponding class from the current list.
Right clicking will only show entries of the corresponding class. You can right click a button and then add more classes: e.g. right clicking the Mage button and then left clicking the Warlock button to get a list of mages and warlocks.

If you want to see players that are currently offline in the list, mark "Show Offline Members" in the guild window.

**In Raid** will only show entries of people that are inside your raid.
**Reset** resets all filters applied.
**Refresh** refreshes the current list.
**X** closes the UI.
